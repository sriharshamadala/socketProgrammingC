v5.04 -- 25-Jun-2012

* Added -p option: hrPing is now a pathping as well!  In pathping mode, hrPing
  will first work like traceroute and find the path to the destination, then
  ping all hops on that path.  Pathping mode honours all useful hrPing options
  like -l, -u, -i, -s, -w, etc.

* Added -c option: concurrent sending.  With this options set to <num>, hrPing
  will keep at maximum <num> pings at a time in transmission.  That means it
  will send a new ping after it received a reply or a timeout of an already
  sent one.  When using -c, -s times are not observed.

+ Added -prec parameter to measure timer precision.  Added -tick parameter, so
  you can compare how bad the standard timer is. :)  Furthermore added support
  for multimedia timer with -mmtime, which gives at least 1000 Hz resolution.

+ Added some more time scales to graphics.

+ Quicker host name resolution in traceroute mode.

x Fixed missing timestamps in front of "Timeout waiting for" lines (-T
  option).  Thanks to Daniel Beardsmore for bug report.

x Fixed "Can't find own IP address!" error.  Thanks to shaori.



v5.00 -- 29-May-2012

! The big new thing is a graphical front-end to display ping results.  The
  front-end is an add-on, so the usual hrPing command line has not changed,
  you can just display all the timings in an extra window!  The graphical
  front-end is called grping.exe and can (so far) not be used alone.

  In the graphic you can change the time scale, show averages and display
  results of multiple ping runs in one graphic.

  How to use it with hrPing:
  Use -g switch to open a new window for the results.
  Use -gg switch like -g, but close that window when hrPing closes.
  Use -G switch to use an already existing grping window to display results;
  this is the way to show more than one graph in one window.

* Added packet size sweep support: -l and -L accept now sizes of the form
  start:end:incrememt.  The packets sent will start with size 'start' and will
  be incremented by 'increment' each time until 'end' is reached, then the
  cycle repeats.

  An added bonus is the calculation of the correlation between the size of the
  packet and the time.  An correlation of > 80% means that there is a strong
  correlation.  If the correlation is >= 40% we print an estimate of the line
  speed. :-)

+ Added printing of timeouts again, plus -qt parameter to switch it off.
  Thanks to Casey Mills for the idea.

+ If -F is set (logging to a file) and -q (or one of -qr, -qe, -qt) as well,
  then there is still no screen output for the specific type of messages, but
  they are written to the log file nevertheless.  Thanks to Matthias Wald for
  the inspiration.

x Fixed a memory leak.

x Fixed a rare crash.

x Hopefully fixed "buffer overflow" errors in log file.  Thanks to Matthias
  Wald.

x "Can't find own IP address!" was issued when the destination host was
  directly connected.  Fixed.



v4.00 -- 26-Mar-2012

* Complete rewrite of hrPING.  I hope, I didn't break too much.  If anything
  doesn't work as expected, please let me know.

  New features:
  * hrPING now uses almost no CPU load.  Old hrPING uses full load on one
    core.
  * The summary option -y now display proper min/max values as well as a
    better lost value.
  * Added -diag option to send all kinds of packets to the destination and
    print what is coming through.
  * ICMP timestamp mode shows petter rx/tx differences.
  * hrPING continues to ping, even if the sockets return an error (like lost
    connectivity).
  * -w timeout is now honoured even if the packet is received, but too late.
    In such a case, the packet is counted as lost.



v3.13 -- 16-Nov-2011

- Switches -n, -l, -L, -i, -v and -I now accepts 0x and 0y prefixes for
  hex and binary arguments.

- hrPING will now only abort after a failed send if it was the frist send.



v3.12 -- 15-Feb-2011

- If -v option (to set TOS byte) is used under Vista+, -H (IP_HDRINCL socket
  option) is automatically set.  Otherwise, setting the TOS byte doesn't
  work any more under Vista+.



v3.11

- Parameter -y now accepts the number of seconds to use for summary as an
  integer parameter.



v3.10 -- 16-Nov-2010

- Added summary option: -y

  With this option set, you get a summary every half second with the total
  statistics and the statistics over the last 5 seconds.

  Furthermore, statistics now show the bandwidth of rx and tx as well.



v3.01 -- 31-Aug-2010

- Fixed UDP pinger.  Now it works really smoothly! :-)

- Added more help when hrPING receives no replies.  Added -fwhelp.



v3.00 -- 31-Aug-2010

- hrPING now supports UDP pinging!  Specify -u to send UDP packets.  Since
  there will be most probably no one replying on the other side, the reply
  will still be an ICMP message (port unreachable).

- hrPING can send and process ICMP timestamp requests.  Use -M to do that.
  Use -O <ofs> to add/subtract <ofs> from the times in case the other's
  clock is set differently.

- Some small fixes.



v2.45

- hrPING works now with Unicode filename as well.

- When -F is specified date/time and commandline args are printed as well.



v2.44 -- 19-Apr-2010

- Added measuring and printing of standard deviation of ping values as well.



v2.43 -- 15-Mar-2010

- Added proper error message if raw socket could not be created.



v2.42 -- 15-Sep-2009

- Default ICMP payload size is now 32, like Windows ping.



v2.41 -- 11-Sep-2009

- Added -qr, -qe, -qt switches to switch off only reply, error resp. timeout
  printing.  Thanks to Henno Täht for the idea.



v2.40 -- 10-Sep-2009

- When -T is set, print timestamp in front of "Request timed out." lines as
  well (non-overlapped mode).  Thanks to Henno Täht for report.



v2.39 -- 26-Feb-2009

- hrPING now works better if the payload is unexpected on Echo-Replies.
  Thanks to Steffen Heuel for the idea.



v2.38 -- 07-Nov-2007

- Added route_debug -R switch to find problems with own_ip address.



v2.37

- Added support to send pings to broadcast address (255.255.255.255)
  as well.



v2.35 -- 13-Apr-2007

- Added -S option to add sent/recv/missing stats to every output line.
  Thanks to paggio for inspiration.

- Display MTU on ICMP message "fragmentation needed, but DF set".



v2.34 -- 14-Feb-2007

- Fixed a bug where commandline switches -n, -l, -L, -i, -w, -s, -v, -Q
  and -I would not work anymore.  Thanks to Günter Niedermeier for his
  report.

- Added Windows Vista manifest and signature.



v2.33 -- 22-Nov-2006

- Fixed a GPF when domain name could not be resolved.

- Updated documentation.



v2.31

- New errorlevels, see hrping.txt.

- New -q parameter: don't print a line per ping.

- New -I parameter: set ICMP id field.



v2.27 -- 16-Feb-2004

- New -F parameter: log output to file as well as to screen.

- New -T parameter: precede every output line with a date/timestamp.
  Thanks to George A. van Dorth for these ideas.



v2.26 -- 29-Jan-2004

- Total time is more accurate now.



v2.25 -- 15-Jan-2004

- Cosmetic fixes.

- Traceroute mode would stop after less than 30 hops if the last hops
  didn't answer.  More thanks to Robert Dinges.

- New -W parameter.  Warm-up was default until now, but is no longer.



v2.24 -- 14-Jan-2004

- If the last ping in traceroute mode produced a "*", the hops' IP
  address would not be printed, even if some earlier ping to the same
  host succeeded.  Fixed.  Thanks to Robert Dinges for his tip.



v2.23 -- 10-Nov-2003

- Added display of IP Identification field.  Thanks to Daniel Hahler
  and c't magazine for the idea.  See c't 23/2003, p. 212 for more
  info.
  The field is read in network (i.e. non-intel) byte order.



v2.22 -- 28-Feb-2003

- Fixes so hrPING works with IPSec.  Thanks to Frank Sauter for
  testing.

- Added parameter to -a option.



v2.20 -- 21-Feb-2003

- Traceroute mode now can do an arbitrary number of tests per hop.
  Specify behind the -r parameter.



v2.10

- Added -Q<vsn> to check if hrPING has at least version <vsn>.
  Errorlevel will be 2 if it has at least the specified version,
  1 otherwise.



v2.02

- Added -E switch.  hrPING will stop pinging, if the file specified
  after -E exists.  Note that it still honours the -t, -n switches.

- hrPING will return errorlevel 0 only if all ping packets were
  replied (sequence does not matter, though).



v2.01 -- 13-Sep-2002

- First public release.
